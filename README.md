# The Dotfiles Journey
Welcome to my dotfiles readme. By the end of this readme you will have a better understanding of three things:
* What dotfiles are
* How dotfiles work
* The huge benefit of having your own set of dotfiles

## tl/dr;
Dotfiles will allow you to customize your system, your shell, and help optimize your machine setup workflow. They are best used in a script which is used to automate importing your development settings, shell settings and applications.
## Introduction
Dotfiles are used to customize your system. The word "dotfiles" originates from configuration files in Unix-like systems that start with a dot (think .bash_profile and .git_config). They are hidden by default in directory listings.

The dotfiles community is very large. You can find many repo's on github of people hosting and organizing their dotfiles. As I mentioned, dotfiles originated from Unix-style systems, and thus this readme focuses mainly on OSX and Linux.

## Preparing for the worst
### My personal spiel
If you are like me, then your journey to becoming a proficient developer/technology enthusiast has involved many computer crashes, clean OS installs and computer self diagnosis. Long story short, I have dealt with my fair share of computer malfunctions, hard drive crashes and computer malfunctions. I have reinstalled my operating system more times than I can count and I understand how painful and time consuming it can be, especially when you feel like your computer configuration is perfect and really allows you to be productive.
